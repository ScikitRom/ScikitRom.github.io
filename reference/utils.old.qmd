`utils.old`

## utils.old {.doc-section .doc-section-utilsold}


Legacy utility functions and experimental prototypes retained for reference and backward compatibility.

This subpackage contains all "old" or deprecated utility routines that have since been superseded by newer, more robust implementations in the main `utils` package. It allows you to review earlier approaches and compare behavior against current methods.

Available modules (non-exhaustive):

- `svd_mode_selectors_old.py`  : Original SVD mode selection routines using basic cumulative-energy thresholds.
- `approximating_ln.py`        : Naive series-expansion algorithm for natural logarithm approximation.
- `magnetic_field_utils_old.py`: Early SFML-based routines for drawing electric and magnetic field visualizations.
- `kotter_change_plan.py`      : Preliminary Kotter’s Eight-Step Change Management plan generator.
- `dehydration_monitor_old.py` : Prototype hydration-tracking functions for Alzheimer’s monitoring device.
- `wavelet_basics.py`          : Initial implementations of wavelet transform utilities.

## Examples {.doc-section .doc-section-examples}

```python
>>> from utils.old import svd_mode_selectors_old
>>> modes, U = svd_mode_selectors_old.svd_mode_selector(data_matrix, tolerance=1e-2)
```
