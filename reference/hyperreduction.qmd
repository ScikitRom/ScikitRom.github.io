`hyperreduction`

The `hyperreduce` package provides tools to perform hyper‐reduction on full‐order models.

Contents:
  - `bilinear_form_hyperrom.py` & `linear_form_hyperrom.py`: Classes that cluster elements
    by free‐DOF counts, project local stiffness/load contributions onto reduced bases,
    and assemble global reduced matrices/vectors.
  - `hyperreduce.py`: End‐to‐end pipeline combining randomized SVD preprocessing with
    bounded NNLS solves for weight selection, plus plotting diagnostics.
  - `custom_nnls.py`: Wrapped NNLS solver specialized for hyper‐reduction constraints.

These modules streamline the construction of sparse, hyper‐reduced operators and right‐hand
sides for fast, accurate reduced‐order simulations.
