`rom.ecsw`

The `ecsw` folder implements Empirical Cubature Subset Weighting (ECSW) methods.

Contents:
  - `nnls_solver.py`: Active‐set bounded NNLS solver (`NNLSSolver`) with L₂/L∞ criteria
    for computing nonnegative cubature weights under per-entry bounds.
  - Utilities for convergence testing (`NNLS_termination`), argument verification,
    and solver configuration.

Together, these tools select and weight integration points to approximate high‐dimensional
integrals with a sparse subset, enabling efficient reduced‐order model assembly.
