Finite‐element utilities for full‐order model (FOM) workflows.

This module provides helpers for:
  - Mesh‐ and basis‐related operations
  - Assembly of stiffness/mass matrices and load vectors
  - Application of boundary conditions and integration routines

The `fom` folder contains everything needed to build and solve
full‐order PDE models, including:
  - Mesh management and basis function definitions
  - System assembly routines (matrices, RHS)
  - Solver interfaces and preconditioners
  - Diagnostic and post‐processing tools
