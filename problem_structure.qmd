![Linear Elasticity](beam_vid.mp4)

This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates the complete process of developing a reduced-order model (ROM) for a three-dimensional linear elastic structure using scikit-rom. You'll learn how each component operates, understand the interconnections between files, and discover how to build an affine ROM that enables real-time or near-real-time simulations.

## Problem Description

We analyze a 3D block governed by linear elasticity principles. The structure features two distinct material regions with different stiffness properties, enabling demonstration of spatially varying material handling through affine decomposition. Core characteristics include:

**Linear Affine Elasticity**: The stiffness matrix is constructed as a linear combination of blocks that are affine in the Lamé parameters $(\lambda, \mu)$.

**Domain Partitioning**: The block is divided into two regions with distinct elastic properties.

**Parameter Space**: Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ are sampled for both offline and online ROM phases.

**Boundary Conditions**: Dirichlet constraints (fixed displacement) on one face; Neumann conditions (applied traction) on the opposing face.

## Project Architecture

The simulation workflow is organized through the following directory structure and files:

```         
problem_1/
├─ domain.py           # Mesh generation, basis setup, boundary and region partitioning
├─ bilinear_forms.py   # Affine weak form (stiffness) assembly
├─ linear_forms.py     # Load (traction) right-hand side term
├─ properties.py       # Lamé parameter computation per region
├─ params.py           # Sampling (E, ν) for training and testing
└─ problem_def.py      # Main orchestration: assembles all components for scikit-rom
└─ problem_1.ipynb     # Executes the complete workflow starting from data generation to model reduction
```

## 1. Geometry & Finite Element Framework — domain.py

**Mesh Construction**: The domain represents a 3D block discretized with hexahedral elements, parameterized by dimensions $(l_x, l_y, l_z)$ and mesh refinement factor for resolution control.

**Basis Functions**: Employs vector-valued trilinear hexahedral elements to represent 3D displacement fields.

**Boundary Identification**:

-   `'left'`: Dirichlet (fixed displacement)
-   `'right'`: Neumann (applied load)

**Region Partitioning**: The mesh is divided along the $x$-axis at the midpoint into:

-   `region_1`: $x \leq 0.5 \cdot l_x$ (stiffer region)
-   `region_2`: $x > 0.5 \cdot l_x$ (softer region)

The module returns a comprehensive dictionary containing the mesh, bases, boundary DOFs, and a per-region basis dictionary for subsequent operator assembly.

## 2. Material Properties & Affine Coefficient Functions — properties.py

**Lamé Parameters**: Transforms Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\nu$ into Lamé parameters $(\lambda, \mu)$ using skfem utilities.

**Region Handling**:

-   For `region_1`, both $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are scaled by $50\times$ (stiffer inclusion)
-   For `region_2`, properties remain unchanged (baseline material)

## 3. Affine Stiffness Matrix Assembly — bilinear_forms.py

**Affine Bilinear Forms**:

-   `stiffness_lam`: Weak form for the $\lambda$ (volumetric) component
-   `stiffness_mu`: Weak form for the $\mu$ (shear) component

**Mathematics**: Each block is computed per-region (using basis restriction). The global stiffness matrix is expressed as:

$K(E,\nu) = \sum_{\text{regions}} \lambda \cdot K_{\lambda,\text{region}} + \mu \cdot K_{\mu,\text{region}}$

**Parameter-Dependent Evaluation**: Lamé parameters are computed as needed for each region via the region-aware property function.

This approach ensures the assembly aligns with the affine decomposition essential for efficient ROM evaluation.

## 4. Right-Hand Side (Loads) — linear_forms.py

**Neumann Traction**: Implements a constant traction (-1e-2) in the global $y$-direction applied to the 'right' face.

**Affine in Parameters**: The load vector is parameter-independent and only needs to be assembled once for the entire ROM process.

## 5. Parameter Sampling — params.py

**Parameter Ranges**:

-   $E$: \[2.0, 10.0\]
-   $\nu$: \[0.2, 0.4\]

**Sampling Strategy**: Uses Sobol sequences to create quasi-random sets of $(E,\nu)$ pairs for:

-   Training snapshots (for ROM basis construction)
-   Testing snapshots (for validation)

**Masks Provided**: Returns boolean arrays to cleanly separate training vs testing data.

## 6. Problem Orchestration — problem_def.py

**Master Problem Class**: Inherits from the scikit-rom base and registers essential routines:

-   `domain()`: Loads mesh and DOFs from domain.py
-   `bilinear_forms()`: Returns affine weak forms for $\lambda$ and $\mu$
-   `linear_forms()`: Returns the Neumann loading routine
-   `properties()`: Returns the regionwise Lamé parameter mapper
-   `parameters(n_samples)`: Returns parameter sets and train/test split

**Affine Operator Assembly**: On the first solve, stiffness and load "blocks" are assembled separately for each region/material.

**Full-Order Solve**: Assembles and solves the condensed system with Dirichlet BCs for each parameter instance.

**ROM Projection**: Projects global blocks onto the reduced basis, incorporating an offline mean-shift to keep the ROM centered.

This design ensures a clear separation between model definition (problem file) and algorithmic ROM machinery (provided by scikit-rom).

## 7. Offline Workflow: Building the ROM

**Step-by-step process**:

1.  **Parameter Sampling**: Generate $n$ training samples $(E_i, \nu_i)$ using the routine from params.py.
2.  **Full-Order Simulations**: For each parameter, solve the full high-fidelity FEM system and store the solution as a snapshot.
3.  **Data Processing**:
    -   **Mean Subtraction**: Subtract the mean from all snapshots to center the dataset
    -   **SVD/POD**: Perform singular value decomposition on the mean-subtracted snapshots to find the dominant modes (energy-ranked spatial patterns)
    -   **Mode Truncation**: Retain only the leading $r$ modes (user- or error-determined) for reduced basis
4.  **Reduced Operator Assembly**: Project per-region blocks $(K_{\lambda,\text{region}}, K_{\mu,\text{region}})$ into the reduced space, yielding ultra-compact operators.

The reduced model is now ready for very rapid online predictions.

## 8. Online Workflow: Fast Evaluation

For a new parameter set $(E, \nu)$:

1.  **Compute Per-Region Lamé Parameters**: Map input parameters to $(\lambda, \mu)$ values for each region.
2.  **Assemble Reduced Stiffness**: Combine precomputed regionwise blocks using affine expressions.
3.  **Solve Reduced System**: The resulting linear system has size equal to the number of modes $(r \ll N)$, making it extremely fast.
4.  **Mean Recovery**: Add back the mean field to produce the full-field displacement solution, ready for visualization or further analysis.

## 9. Validation & Error Assessment

**Test Set**: Evaluate the ROM on held-out (never-seen) parameter pairs.

**Error Metrics**:

-   Relative error (L2 or energy norm) between ROM and high-fidelity FOM solutions
-   Statistical fit metrics (e.g., R² score)

**Speed-up Factor**: The ROM typically achieves significant speed-up (often orders of magnitude) versus direct FEM.

## 10. Summary Table of Key Methods

| Method | Purpose | Typical Location in Pipeline |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| `domain()` | Setup mesh, BCs, DOFs, and per-region bases | First, before assembly |
| `bilinear_forms()` | Return affine form handles for λ, μ | Operator initialization |
| `linear_forms()` | Specify right-hand-side (load) | Operator assembly |
| `properties()` | Map (E, ν, region) → (λ, μ) | Parameter unpacking |
| `parameters()` | Produce sampled (E, ν) + train/test masks | Offline/online split |
| `fom_solver()` | Run and store full-order solutions | Snapshot generation (offline) |
| `rom_solver()` | Assemble and solve projected ROM system | Rapid online prediction |

## 11. Best Practices

-   Always center your snapshot data before SVD to ensure best POD convergence
-   Use enough training samples (and parameter space coverage) to avoid overfitting or "holes" in ROM accuracy
-   Check ROM error on multiple, unseen test samples
-   Visualize spatial error fields—not just scalar error metrics—for insight into local ROM limitations
-   Leverage the modular file structure for extending to other domains, BCs, and PDEs

This workflow and modular codebase provide a flexible, scalable foundation for reduced-order modeling of parametrized PDEs in computational mechanics, accelerating simulation, optimization, and interactive design.
